  - title : Do you cut and mill your own lumber?
    content : Sometimes! We are constantly on the lookout for trees in our area that have fallen naturally, have been removed by a local aborist, have had to come down for a meaningful reason. We don't cut down trees _just_ for the lumber. We also work with local sawmills and small-scale producers to find quality wood. Once we find a tree or a stack of nice rough-cut lumber, we do whatever is required to mill, dry, or even kiln-dry the wood until it's ready to be made into something beautiful and useful.

  - title : Do you know where every piece of wood comes from?
    content : We wish! Sadly some species of wood don't grow in North Carolina, but we really think they're cool and beaufiful. With that said, we do our very best to source local lumber. That's a big reason why you'll see lots of less common wood in our products like [sweetgum](https://www.arborday.org/trees/treeguide/treedetail.cfm?itemID=928).

  - title : Do you handle custom commissions?
    content : Sometimes, and with a few conditions. Our workshop is just under 400 square feet (just over 37 square meters). We simply don't have room for that beautiful kitchen table you've always wanted. We wish we did. We focus on smaller household utility and decorative stuff. If your idea is something in that realm, feel free to send us a message at custom@oakcityhardwoods.com. 

  - title: What do I do if my shiny new thing messes up?
    content: That beautiful cutting board or rolling pin we just sent you with its own serial number and attached story was once one or more living, aspirating organisms. Just read the story we included about where the wood came from. We do our level best, but something wood doesn't cooperate and you end up with a split joint or a bent cutting board. If that happens, just email support@oakcityhardwoods.com and we'll get you sorted out. If you did something silly and put your cutting board in the dishwasher, then you're going to be on your own and we're just going to be sad.

  - title: Is this your full time job?
    content: Again, we wish! Maybe one day we'll update this, but as for right now this is a passion project that has become an obsession and will one day likely be my retirement plan.
